# Prevalence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism among people vaccinated with the Pfizer BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines in England

This is the code and configuration for a project which aimed to describe the prevalence of different thrombotic risk factors according to type of COVID-19 vaccine received among people in England. The project was paused after preliminary results were generated and the aims incorporated into another project. Due to the rapidly developing science at the time, we did not consider the preliminary data to have value which merited sumbitting for a separate publication. 

# About the OpenSAFELY framework

The OpenSAFELY framework is a secure analytics platform for
electronic health records research in the NHS.

Instead of requesting access for slices of patient data and
transporting them elsewhere for analysis, the framework supports
developing analytics against dummy data, and then running against the
real data *within the same infrastructure that the data is stored*.
